# Smart_Door_Lock
This system has successfully managed to fulfill its objective of preventing the access of unauthorized persons and informing the owner when a guest arrives.When any visitor comes to the home and presses the door bell button, a camera that is built into the ESP32 cam board captures a photo and sends a notification to the homeowner over the Blynk cloud in the Blynk app. After that, the owner can see the photo of the visitor, and if he or she wants to unlock the door, he or she can do so by giving the command “Unlock door” to the Google Assistant.
